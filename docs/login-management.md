Plausible Analytics offers a security feature that allows you to remotely log out of your account on other devices via your account settings.

## How to log out of your Plausible account remotely

* Log in to your Plausible Analytics account and in the top right menu, click on your account name and choose "**Account Settings**" to enter your account settings.
* In the "**Security**" section, find “**Login Management**” where you can see a list of all your active logged-in sessions.
* Click the trash icon next to the session you wish to end.

Note that all Plausible logged-in sessions automatically expire after 14 days of inactivity.

You can also enable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](2fa.md) as an extra security layer for your Plausible account.
